## Day 1 (Monday) - Vision Post with ATL Flavor

**Caption:**
"ATLANTA 🍑 Let's talk about why I built @hipopmarkets...

Y'all ever been to Grant Park Market looking for that fire bread vendor but can't find them? Or drove to Piedmont Park just to find out your fav soap lady isn't there today? 😤

After months of watching this chaos (and experiencing it myself every weekend), I knew we needed something better. 

HiPop isn't some Silicon Valley app trying to "disrupt" our markets. Nah. This is BY Atlanta FOR Atlanta - built by someone who's at these markets every weekend just like you 🌱

We're making it stupid easy to:
✨ Find your favorite vendors across ALL markets
📍 Discover new markets you didn't even know existed  
🔔 Get notified when that limited-edition hot sauce drops
🗺️ See exactly where vendors are set up (no more wandering!)

## Day 2 (Tuesday) - Behind the Scenes + Community

**Caption:**
"Real talk - building HiPop has been WILD 🚀

6 months of:
• Late nights coding after my day job 💻
• Testing at markets every single weekend 
• Talking to 100+ vendors (shoutout to everyone who gave feedback!)
• Learning that market wifi is... not great 😅
• Discovering SO many hidden gem markets

The moment it clicked? I was at East Atlanta Village Market and watched 3 different people ask vendors "where's the tamale guy?" He was literally 2 booths over but invisible in the crowd.

That's when I knew - we NEED this.

Today we're live and I'm honestly emotional about it. Atlanta's market community raised me, and now I get to give back 🙏

Drop a ❤️ if you've ever gotten lost looking for a vendor!
